## Personal Portfolio

Hi! I'm Steve and thanks for visiting the About page.

I'm currently enrolled in an online [Software Engineering](https://www.bloc.io/software-developer-track) program through [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/about). The program focus is computer science and full-stack web development.

I've developed a strong foundation in backend programming, specifically object oriented programming with Ruby on Rails,  MVC architecture, Test Driven Development, and more. I'm currently developing frontend programming skills with frameworks and tools such as, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. The later portion of the program will cover computer science principles: data structures, algorithms and complexity analysis, databases and advanced SQL, and framework architecture and design patterns.

This website is a place for me to showcase my progress, current projects, completed projects, and anything else I feel is important to share. My hope is that it will also provide to be a source of inspiration for anyone interested or currently in related fields.

Most importantly, I'm happily married with a wild and crazy one year old. If I'm not sitting in front of a computer hacking the planet, or getting my mind blown away by some new programming concept, I'm usually outside running, surfing, biking, climbing, or chilling with my family.

Hope you enjoy!
