title: Bloc Capstone - Jann Marie Bridal
---
It is crazy to think that just over two months ago I started [Bloc's](https://www.bloc.io/software-developer-track) software engineering track. This post is to showcase my capstone project for the first segment of the course, which is backend development with Ruby on Rails. After completing several of the Bloc projects I figured the capstone project would be a great way to practice and solidify some newly developed skills.

For the project, I chose to build a simple web application for my wife and her business. She is a talented seamstress that specializes in making custom wedding dresses. I have provided a video walk through below, but the gist of the application is an on-boarding solution for her and her clients. It is a simple and easy way for her clients to provide their specific measurements and other important information. It is also a great way for my wife to manage her clients and interact with them in a unique way. While this application is simple upfront I could see it evolving over time.

While building this web application I was able to build on skills learned from previous projects. I was able to better understand [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) and how to customize it for the applications particular features. I also took some time to customize the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) layout and style by familiarizing myself with HTML and CSS syntax. You'll see in the video below that I included a logo, several images, tables, a different color scheme, and more. I even honed in on TDD, however I still need a lot of work in this area. And lastly, the most important thing I did was ramp up my understanding of MVC and how each piece fits together. Specifically, I got more comfortable generating/changing database tables and running migrations.

All in all this project was an excellent opportunity for me to sharpen the skills developed over the past couple months. I look forward to starting the front-end portion of this program. I have learned a ton and have so much more to learn.
